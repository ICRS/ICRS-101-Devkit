# ICRS-101-Devkit
This library is intended for use in the Arduino IDE with the ICRS 101 devkit to enable certain functions.

This library overrides several basic arduino functions to communicate with the onboard STM32. This allows extra functions such as the built in motor drivers, servo headers and LEDs to function seemlessly.
